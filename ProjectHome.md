Forest is an overlay network designed to support large, online virtual worlds, and other applications that require scalable, real-time communication among a potentially large set of communicating endpoints. Application sessions in Forest are built around tree-structured communication channels called comtrees (hence the name, Forest). Comtrees are conceptually similar to private VLANs in an Ethernet network and can be provisioned to ensure that an application session always has enough capacity to handle its traffic.
